# NGINX

NGINX is the de-facto standard for web servers, next to Apache. I'm more familiar
with NGINX then Apache so it is my preference. If no actually web server would be
needed and we just need to proxy requests, HA Proxy is my choice. It is the most
performant load balancer out there easy configuration.
